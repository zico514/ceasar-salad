*Step 1: Prep Romaine*


Wash romaine lettuce, then chop it into bite-size pieces and spin it dry in a salad spinner. If you don't have a salad spinner, shake the water off as well as possible, then wrap the lettuce chunks in a kitchen towel or paper towels and squeeze gently to dry them off. This is important because you don't want to dilute your tasty dressing with boring water.



*Step 2: Combine Acids*

Juice two large lemons, then top off with 1/2 lemon's worth of cider vinegar.  (1 part vinegar to 4 parts lemon juice)

This should bring you up to about half a cup.

Rice vinegar or malt vinegar are also acceptable substitutes; the idea is to add a separate, interestingly flavored acid source to really bring out the lemon flavor. You can use white vinegar in a pinch, but it's a bit boring.



*Step 3: Add Garlic*

Use a microplane grater to grate 2-4 large cloves of garlic directly into your lemon juice mix.  This will break open more cells than chopping, and basically "weaponize" your garlic - plus there won't be any big chunks to distract you from the salad eating experience.



*Step 4: Add Egg Yolks*

Separate two eggs, and add the yolks to the dressing.  (The ratio is one yolk per lemon juiced.)

You can use the whites as well if you like, but yolks-only will make for a richer, creamier dressing.  



*Step 5: Add Mustard*
Add Mustard
Add a scoop of prepared mustard, about one teaspoon.  Dijon is fine, as is most any type of mustard. Yum.



*Step 6: Add Fresh Ground Pepper*

Grind some fresh pepper into your dressing.  I like to add some coarsely-ground pepper, and some finely-ground pepper for flavor/texture variety.


*Step 7: Add Anchovy Fillets*
Drain the oil from one can of anchovies, and add the fillets to the dressing.  Yes, all of them,  and if your anchovies aren't packed in olive oil, you should buy better anchovies.  


*Step 8: Season & Blend*
Add a teaspoon of Worchestershire sauce, and eyeball the quantity of dressing you've got.  Add olive oil to roughly double the volume, and blend with your trusty stick blender until fully emulsified.  


*Step 9: Mix and Serve*
Toss the salad greens with most of the dressing, then add croutons and shaved parmesan cheese and toss again.  The croutons will absorb a bit of dressing, so you may need to add some of your reserved dressing.  Serve immediately.  This salad goes particularly well with meals that include large chunks of meat, especially when grilled on a hot summer afternoon, but really is good for any meal with flavors strong enough to stand up to it.
